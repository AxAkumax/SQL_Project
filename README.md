SQL Project with project.py code, and test_data folder (with CSV files in it)
notice:
I changed the name of the file in our test_data from use.csv to used.csv, 
as there will be a syntax issue when trying to insert data into the 'use' table, 
because use is a reserved keyword in MySQL, so you guys can use the test_data folder that I pushed to the github, 
so that there's won't be any error when inserting data into 'use' table
